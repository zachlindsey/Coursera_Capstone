    "The Foursquare API provides all data needed for this project. For each user-specified category and price range, a (standard!) call to the venues-explore endpoint gives some data to get started: the location and name of the venue. We can then (ignoring hours for now) string together some lists of venues that are sufficiently close and of the order and type specified by the user. Once valid combinations of venues are found, we can verify the hours using the premium calls to the venues-hours endpoint and return the suggested iteneraries."
